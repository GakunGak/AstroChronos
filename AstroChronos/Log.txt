I did not intend to have a development log, but here we are...

I was clueless about why Mars and Venus symbol render with thick black square border around them. 
Turns out...default Segoe UI font cannot render them properly. I needed to specify another font
to be used - Segoe UI Symbols.

Stupid and unneccessary.

Also, I finally developed a formula to calculate each planetary day without hardcoding stuff. 
I knew there was a way to do it programmatically. And I was right!

Let's go!!!

You know that feeling when you want to solve a problem in certain way because you think it would be better that way?
Even though there are other solutions that would have taken way less time...no, you continute with your stubborness 
because you know there has to be a way to accomplish the task the way you imagined it.

And once you find it out? Gods...if you ever experienced something like this, you know the feeling.

If you didn't, well I hope one day you will know what I'm talking about.

The app is nearing completion. I just need to figure out threading (app needs to update hours in background) and location picking.

Been procastriniating for more than a week. WPF apps do not support transparency blur. There are ways to kinda make it work,
but "solutions" are very hacky. Bummer.
